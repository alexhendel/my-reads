# MyReads Project

This is a project developed for my React course on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). The app allows you to organize your your books in categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read.

The app was based on the starter template found [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `yarn`
- start the development server with `yarn start`

## Release

To build the app use `yarn build` and deploy the **build** folder contents to a webserver of your choice.
